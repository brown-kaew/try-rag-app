Note 2: The current listed positions have been published in the Official Kcon Book 2018.

Note 3: Source for TWICE’s MBTI results: TWICE TV “Finding TWICE’s MBTI”. Jihyo updated her MBTI result on August 19, 2022 (previously ISFP-T). Nayeon (previously ISTP-A), Jeongyeon (previously ISFP), and Mina (previously ISFP-T) updated their results in Oct. 2022 during “Talk that Talk” Comeback Week. Jeongyeon updated her MBTI to ESFJ in Dec. 2024 (Source).

Note 4: Usually companies adjust the idols’ official profiles, so it looks better. For example, Chaeyoung‘s official height is 163 cm (5’4″), but during TWICE Private Life show, when she measured her height, it could be easily seen she’s actually 158.9 cm (5’3″). From there, the fans did the math and approximated their real height. So, we posted both versions. Dahyun was also measured on Real Men and she was 158,6 cm, though she usually looks taller than Chaeyoung. Tzuyu was confirmed to be 170 cm tall on her birthday VLIVE (14 June 2020) and confirmed once again her height being 170 cm (Source), in the same video Jihyo confirmed her height is 162 cm. Momo was confirmed to be 163 cm on TWICE Star Road (Episode 14). Jeongyeon confirmed her exact height is 167.7 cm (Source).
