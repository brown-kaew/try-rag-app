NMIXX, known pre-debut as JYPn, is a six-member girl group under JYP Entertainment. They debuted, originally with seven members, on February 22, 2022, with the single album "AD MARE" and the song "O.O".

Beginning in August of 2021, JYP Entertainment launched JYPn's pre-promotion project, which teased fans with a variety of song and dance covers featuring the members. It was confirmed that the group will debut in February 2022. A limited-edition single, then called “Blind Package”, was available for pre-order from July 16-25, and fans who want to get their hands on this release should order it during the 10-day period.

The single will be delivered in February 2022, along with a limited edition CD, photo book, poster, premium membership card, random Polaroid, and other goodies. JYP Entertainment announced that “Blind Package” sold 60,000 copies in the pre-order period, showing the group’s popularity.

The group’s debut single album, “AD MARE”, attracted a lot of attention with its genre-mixing lead track. Their agency has stated that the group does not have any fixed positions, but rather allows each member to showcase their skills as vocalists, dancers, and visuals.

On December 9, 2022, it was announced that Jini would be leaving the group and JYP Entertainment, leaving NMIXX to continue on with the six remaining members: Lily, Haewon, Sullyoon, Bae, Jiwoo, and Kyujin.
