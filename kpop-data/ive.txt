Note 3: Rei confirmed her height is 170 cm (5’7″) (Source). Yujin confirmed her height as 173 cm (5’8″) (Source). Liz confirmed her height is around 171~2 cm (5’8″) (Source). Leeseo confirmed her height is 165 cm (5’5″) (Source).

Note 4: Rei herself confirmed she is the main rapper (Source (1:53). Leeseo‘s Lead Dancer position and Wonyoung‘s dance position have been confirmed on their official Melon profile. Also that Rei, Leeseo and Gaeul are Sub-Vocalists. Liz‘s main vocalist position was confirmed on her official Melon profile (Source X). Yujin‘s main dancer position was confirmed in Earth Arcade Ep 1 (Source: X / Screenshot X 아이브 메인댄서 = IVE’s Main Dancer).

*Editor’s comment regarding the member’s positions: In the article many believed claimed that Yujin is the official main vocalist, that was not confirmed. The article praises Yujin’s vocals saying, “In the case of Yujin, the charm of her vocals doubled. The vocal teacher praised, ‘I focused on singing in a variety of tones while adjusting the speed.'” along with later in the article, “‘When I think of the member who is exceptionally good at vocals in IVR, Yujin is the first that comes to mind.'” Nowhere in that text does the author say anything about a main vocalist position, therefor until a confirmation I will not give anyone the position of Main Vocalist.
However, that article does indeed confirm Gaeul as the main dancer. Once translated to English, the article states “Autumn is the main dancer of certainty. She made a mark with her powerful performance that contrasted with her innocent appearance. Even in group dance, they dominated the stage with neat dance lines.” The text says Autumn as Gaeul means Autumn in Korean. Gaeul‘s Lead Rapper position has been confirmed on their official Melon profile.
