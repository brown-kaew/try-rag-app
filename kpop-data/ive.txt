IVE is a six-member girl group under Starship Entertainment. They debuted on December 1, 2021, with their chart-topping single album "ELEVEN" and became one of their generation's most popular girl groups. Their official introduction is "Dive into Ive, Hello we are Ive."

The group's debut was highly anticipated as two of the members, Yujin and Wonyoung, were already well-known for being former members of IZ*ONE. The rest of the members also garnered interest from the public with their unique charms and talents, showcased in their different covers and pre-debut performances.

On February 15, 2022, IVE was named "Rookie of the Year" at the 2021 Hanteo Music Awards.

On April 11, 2023, just one day after IVE’s comeback with their first full-length album “I’ve IVE” Starship Entertainment announced that Rei would temporarily be halting all activities to focus on recovering her health.
