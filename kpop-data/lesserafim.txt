LE SSERAFIM is a South Korean girl group under Source Music, a subsidiary of HYBE Labels. The group consists of five members: Sakura, Kim Chaewon, Huh Yunjin, Kazuha, and Hong Eunchae. Their name is an anagram of "I'm Fearless," symbolizing confidence and determination.

LE SSERAFIM debuted on May 2, 2022, with the mini-album FEARLESS. Initially a six-member group, Kim Garam went on hiatus on May 20, 2022, following bullying accusations. On July 20, 2022, HYBE and Source Music announced the termination of her contract, finalizing her departure and establishing LE SSERAFIM as a five-member group.

Despite the lineup change, the group quickly rose to prominence with their second EP, ANTIFRAGILE (October 2022), which sold over a million copies and made them the fastest Kpop girl group to debut on the US Billboard 200 at the time. Their first studio album, UNFORGIVEN (2023), marked their first number-one album on the Circle Album Chart and their first top-ten entry on the Billboard 200. The singles Unforgiven and Eve, Psyche & the Bluebeardâ€™s Wife both peaked at No. 2 in South Korea and achieved gold certification for streaming in Japan.

In 2023, their English single Perfect Night became their first No. 1 song on the Circle Digital Chart, maintaining its position for six weeks. In 2024, LE SSERAFIM earned their second number-one album in South Korea with their third EP, EASY. The title track also marked their debut entry on the US Billboard Hot 100, further solidifying their global presence.
